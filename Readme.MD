# Form Validation Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a form validation system using JavaScript to provide live inline validation feedback. Users are required to fill in their Email, Country, Zip Code, Password, and Password Confirmation. The form validates these inputs in real-time and highlights any errors to ensure all fields are correctly filled before submission.
